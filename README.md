# Procedural Generation in Unity
This repository contains five different projects made using the Unity3D engine following some tutorials created by Jasper Flick, avaliable [here](https://catlikecoding.com/). 

These projects were developed following some tutorials created by Jasper Flick, avaliable [here](https://catlikecoding.com/).
Below you will find some pictures and brief explanaitions about each one of them.

## Graphs
This project was made using the Unity Particle System component and consists of several different representations of graphs in 2D, 3D and 4D. Here are the four graphs that I find most interesting: 3D ripple and 3D sine at the top and 4D ripple and 4D sine at the bottom.

Running the project you can see the graphs being updated at real time, giving them a more vivid appearance.

## Fractal
A kind of fractal generated dynamically each time the scene is started. You can choose to let it static or make it's parts rotate around each other.

## Maze
A maze generated dynamically and randomly each time the scene is started, resulting in a differente maze each time.

## Splines
A spline editor that can be used inside the Unity editor to create curves and splines. Such splines can then be used to position objects in them, as shown below.

## Noise Derivatives
A noise generator that can generate perlin and value noise. It was after updated to generate surfaces and particles flow.
